Visual-Of-Perception
Visual-Of-Perception is an interactive project management environment designed to visualize nodes as planets and galaxies in a dynamic 3D universe. Built using Three.js, the platform offers real-time collaboration, user-modifiable layouts, and customizable scenes for enhanced project visualization and control.

Features
Modular Node System: Nodes are represented as planets in a grid or radial layout.
3D Universe: Navigate through projects as if exploring a galaxy of interconnected nodes.
Real-Time Collaboration: Up to 9 users can interact and collaborate on the same scene simultaneously.
Customizable Layouts: Easily switch between grid and radial layouts for visualizing nodes.
Node Interaction: Clickable nodes with color change and interaction features.
Version Control: Built-in versioning and node history tracking.
Responsive UI: The scene adjusts to different screen sizes and window resizing.
